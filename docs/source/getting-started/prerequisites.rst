=============
Prerequisites
=============
This PHP library will need to be running with **at least PHP version 7.1** or higher. You can make sure about this by adding following to your :code:`composer.json` file (:code:`composer require php` doesn't work).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "php": ">=7.1"
        }
    }

With that requirement set, you can now add the library itself.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require d3strukt0r/oauth2-openid
