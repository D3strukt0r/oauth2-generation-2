What things you need to install the software and how to install them

**PHP project using at least PHP 7.1)**

You could for example add the requirement to the composer.json file.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "php": ">=7.1"
        }
    }

And then run

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require d3strukt0r/oauth2-generation-2

Or add it manually to the composer.json file

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "php": ">=7.1",
            "generation-2/oauth2-generation-2": "*"
        }
    }
